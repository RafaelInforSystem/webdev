<p>\r\n          Os\r\n          <strong>ORMs</strong> são ferramentas que, através de regras pré-definidas, criam tabelas ou\r\n          documentos nas bases de dados.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Ou seja, você configura regras para sua base de dados, escreve uma representação, mapa,\r\n          ou modelo das tabelas ou documentos, com a linguagem de programação que você está\r\n          usando para desenvolver sua aplicação.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          E o ORM se encarrega de criar\r\n          a base de dados, gerar as tabelas ou documentos e persitir os dados.\r\n          E tudo isso com o mínimo ou nenhuma linguagem SQL ou NoSQL.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Dessa forma o desenvolvedor tem mais produtividade e segurança na persitência
